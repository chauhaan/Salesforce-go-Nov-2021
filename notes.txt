Golang
    1. Why Golang?
        Portability
        Efficient memory utilization
        Concurrency
        Simplicity
        Performance
        Security
        SDK APIs

    Simplicity
        ONLY 25 keywords
        No classes (only structs)
        No inheritance (only composition)
        No Exceptions (only errors)
        No access modifiers (private, public, protected, internal)

    Concurrency
        Ability to have more than one execution path in a program
        Golang is Built for concurrency
            go, chan, select, range
        Builtin scheduler
        Goroutines are lightweight (4 KB)
        1000s of goroutines can be scheduled using 1 OS thread

    strongly typed
    compiled to machine code
    Performance is comparable to 'C' language
    Garbage collector builtin
    No need for any runtime (like JVM / CLR etc)
    Support for pointers (pointer arithmetic is not supported)
    Everything is 'value' by default (pointers are used for references)





Paradox of Choice
    By Barry Schwartz



To run the program
	go run hello-world.go

To create a build
    go build hello-world.go


Data Types in Go
    bool
    string

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real float32, imaginary float32)
    complex128 (real float64, imaginary float64)

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32) (represents an unicode code point)


Assignment : 1
Calculator Console
Display the below menu again and again until the user chooses 'exit'
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Exit

if user choice = 1 to 4, accept two numbers from the user, perform the respective operation and print the result and display the menu again
if user choice = 5, exit the program
if user choice < 1 or > 5, display an error message and display the menu again
